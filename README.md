# automated-prompter-for-open-QA
This is the main repository for RL course final project.

## Supervised fine-tuning
- finetune.py
  This file is for doing supervised finetuning on prompter model, the result of this model will generate the instruction format when we give it certain prompt.

## Reinforcement learning for (d) and (e)
- training_eval_for_(d).py
  This file is for training (d) and it will evaluate the result of (d).
- training_for_(e).py
  This file is for training (e)
## Result
After SFT and RL,

- result_of_(a).py is to evaluate prompter (a).
- (b) (c) (e) is the same.
